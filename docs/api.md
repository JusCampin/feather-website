# Build on Feather

Use these references to configure Feather resources and integrate your own gameplay systems. Each resource owns a focused responsibility; shared development utilities live in Toolkit.

## API conventions

Most current Feather contracts use named exports and return a structured result:

```lua
{ ok = true, value = value, meta = optionalMeta }
{ ok = false, code = 'stable_code', message = 'Safe summary', details = optionalDetails }
```

Always check `result.ok == true` before reading `result.value`. Calls that mutate gameplay state belong on the server unless a resource reference explicitly marks an export as client-side.

## Finding the right owner

- Use **Core** for accounts, sessions, providers, RPC, locale, guards, policy, events, and notification dispatch.
- Use **Toolkit** for reusable client utilities that do not own a gameplay domain.
- Use the named gameplay resource for domain state such as Character, Inventory, Roles, Routing, or World.
- Pages labeled **REVIEW** describe an older surface that does not currently map to a cloned resource. Treat them as migration context, not a current contract.
